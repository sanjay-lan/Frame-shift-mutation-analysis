# Machine Learning based Bioinformatics Research for E. Coli genome.
This research is focused on exploring hidden stop codons within a gene, particularly in the context of frame-shift mutations. Our analysis led to the conclusion that there is selective pressure from nature on certain codons among all other synonymous codons.

Steps:
  Data extraction
  Data cleaning
  Feature Selection
  Classification
  Confusion matrix
  Visualization
  Evaluation

Libraries & frameworks:
  Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, Boruta.

Classification Algorithms:
  Logistic Regression, Gaussian NB, SVC, Random Forest Classifier, Adaboost Classifier, XGB classifier.
